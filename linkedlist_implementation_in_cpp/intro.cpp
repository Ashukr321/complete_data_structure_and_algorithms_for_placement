/*
  ⭐⭐ array is the static site  
  time complexity -> o(n ) => traversal 
  we can't modify  (increase or decrease the size  of the array )
  array store the data in the contiguous memory allocation.
  insertion and deletion in the array  is the very costly 
  

  linked list  -> 
   dynamic size  allocation  of memory 
  easy to add or remove or  increase or decrease the size of the  linked list 
  non-contigious memory allocation 
  searching is expensive in the   linked list 

  types of the linked list 
    singly linked list 
    doubly linked list 
    singly circular linked list 
    doubly circular linked list 

   listnode -> node  
        data , next pointer
         
        next pointer  => store the address of the next node  

   we have the head pointer that store the address of the first node of  the linked list 
   first node is also know as the head node and last node of the linked is  know as the tail node
