    ⭐ correctness  -> algorisms should be produced correct result  for all possible input.
    
  ⭐  Efficiency :  algorisms should be produced correct result for minimum time and resources .(time and space complexity )
   ⭐ Robustness:  algorithms can be handle different types of input 
   ⭐ Simplicity and Clarity:  algorithms  should be easy to implement and handle  clear and consign 

   ⭐ Optimality:
   ⭐ Scalability: an algorithms must be handle large amount of data input  or problem size without significance decrease in performance
