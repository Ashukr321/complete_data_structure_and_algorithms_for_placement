  //  recurrence relation in the algorithm 
  /*
   recurrence relation are commonly use to define the time complexity of the algorithm 
   ⭐⭐ time and space complexity 
   // time and space complexity is the key aspect of the algorithm 
   time complexity is expressed in terms of the asymptotic notations 

   space complexity is is the refers to  the amount of the space is required to execute the algorithm 
    both time and space complexity is required for evaluating the algorithms 

  recreance relation -> when algorithm contains recursive call func. call it self then the relation is defined by the help of the recreance relation 
   
   to solve the recreance relation we have 3  
   srm
    substituion methods 
    master methods 
    recursive tree methods to solve the time and space complexity
