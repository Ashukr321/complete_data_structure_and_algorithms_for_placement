  type of the tree 
  trick 
    pcb fp 


    p=> perfect tree 
    all left node are at same level 


    c -> complete 
     all the level are filled except the last levels
     and  in the last level start from left filled 

    b -> balanced binary tree 
    height of the left and right subtree is at most one unit of each other
    avl => 


    f => full binary tree  -> all the levels of the tree are full filed 
    the condition of the binary tree 
     
    d-> degenerated tree  
    this is simple looks like   linked list 

    // binary tree 

    binary tree can be balanced and unordered in nature 

    // binary search tree 
    binary search tree is the special type of the binary tree  the nodes in the tree 
    are in specific order 
     rules : 
      all the left node is smaller than the its parent node 
      all the right node is greater than the its parent node

    // drawback of the binary search tree is the if we insert the only greater element then it will extend one sided 
    // to overcome this problem  introduce a new dsa -> bbst 
    balanced binary search tree 

        2 wasy to maintain the balancend binary search tree 
          by using height 
          by color-> red black tree
