## Brute Force Algorithm
  - Straight forward approach to solving a problem
  - Systematic try all possible solutions until the correct solution is found
  - use
    - when size of problem is small
  - ==Application== 
    - password cracking
    - search problem
    - puzzle solving
    - cryptography
## Divide and Conquer Algorithm
  - break complex problem into smaller sub problems
  - solve sub problems recursively
  - ==Application== 
      - Merge sort
      - Quick sort
      - Binary search
      - finding maximum subarray
      - finding closest pair
  
## Dynamic Programming
  - complex problem is broken down into simpler sub problems
  - Each problem solve only once 
  - ways of implementing
    - top down( Memoization)
    - bottom up(Tabulation)
