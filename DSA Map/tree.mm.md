# Tree
## ==Types of Tree==
- Binary Tree
  1. Full binary tree 
  2. Complete binary tree
  3. Perfect binary tree
  4. Degenerate tree

- *==Binary Search Tree==*
  - Rules of BST 
  - Operations 
    - Insert in Binary search tree. tc =(O logn)
    - Search in Binary Search tree. tc = (O logn)
    - Find  ==min== and ==max== in Binary Search tree
    - check is Valid Bst 
    - Sum of the Node  
    - Delete in Binary Search tree
- Balanced binary tree
    - Avl Tree 
    - Red Black Tree 
- B Tree
  - Applications of B Tree
    1. Database
    2. File System
    3. operating system
    4. Network Routing
    5. Caching
    6. Compiler Design
- B+ Tree
- Trie
  - Applications of Trie
  1. Dictionary
  2. Autocomplete
  3. Spelling Checker
- Segment Tree
  - Applications of Segment Tree 
    1. Range Sum Query
    2. Range Minimum Query
    3, Lazy Propagation 
    4. Range Update Query
    5. Internal Problems 
- Heap Tree 
- Generic Tree (N-ary tree)
- ==Expression Tree== 
  leaf node are operands and non leaf node are operators
## Terminology of Tree
- Node
- Root Node  ==(Parent Node)== 
- Child Node
- Edge
- Sibling
- Leaf Node 
- Ancestor
- Descendant
- Internal Node

## Representation of a Tree
- [Tree representation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240424125622/Introduction-to-tree-.webp)
- [Structure of the tree Node ]()

## Traversal of Tree using recursive 
- InOrder Traversal
- PreOrder Traversal
- PostOrder Traversal
- Level Order Traversal
- Traversal of Tree using iterative traversal

## Operations on Binary Tree 
- Insertion
  1. Insert Node at left and right of the tree
- size of tree 
- Maximum of the tree 
- Height of the tree 
- Minimum of the tree
- Search in Binary Tree using recursion 
- print all the internal nodes of the tree
- Find the minimum and maximum height of the tree
- Print the tree node data using level order traversal ( uses queue Ds)
- find the diameter of the binary tree 
- print  reverse level order tree traversal using queue  and stack Ds
- Delete an element from the tree
## Application of tree  Data structure in Real world 
- File System
- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- AI
- Fold
- JSON
- XML
- SQL
- Database
