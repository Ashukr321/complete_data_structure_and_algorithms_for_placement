# Important Concepts
## Palindrome Number
  - numerical value that remains the same when its digits are reversed, such as 121 or 3443.

## Prime Number
  - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
## Armstrong Number
  - number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits, such as 153 (1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153).

## Perfect Number 
 - A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself), such as 6, which has divisors 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
## Automorphic Number
  - An automorphic number is a number whose square ends with the same digits as the number itself. For example
## strong Number
  -  a number for which the sum of the factorials of its digits is equal to the number itself
## Harshed Number
- A Harshad number (or Niven number) is a positive integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits. eg .1
