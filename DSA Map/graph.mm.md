# Graph
## Terminology
  - Vertex
  - Edge
  - Path
  - Cycle
  - Connected
  - Weighted
  - Directed
    - In degree
    - Out degree
  - Undirected
  - Degree of Graph 

## Representation of Graph
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Set
## Graph Traversal
  - Depth First Search (DFS) ==(PreOrder tree traversal)==
